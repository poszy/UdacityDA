# Dont have a particular order ( so you cant say " giver me the 3rd element in this collection ")
# Dont havce to have objects of the same type
# You can have a collectino of anything, with different types.
# shuffeling elements around is irrelevant. weill not make a difference.
# mostly in programming collections are not used. there are different datastructures that are extensiosn of collections like lists.
