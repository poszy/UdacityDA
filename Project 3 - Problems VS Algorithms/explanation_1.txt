For this problem I was able to use a binary search to find the solution. By definition Binary search worst case is O(Log N).


 Base case: O(1)
 While Loop: O(LogN)
 control flow statements: O(1)

 Over all the worst case complexity is O(Log N) and the space complexity is O(1) since I am only taking in an integer.
