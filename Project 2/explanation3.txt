For this function I used a dictionary to hold a set of values and keys and a list. A dictoinary made it easy to save and store the frequencies of the values The worst time complexity for this program comes inside the huffman_decode_helper function where the complexity is O(n^2) because of the nested for and if statements. The space complexity is O(n) based on the length of the set and list.
